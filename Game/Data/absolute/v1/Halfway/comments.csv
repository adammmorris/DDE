Then try the other word in the same number combo. If they both words did not give points, then I would switch to the other number and try them. The green screen I just did randomly.","22"

I felt it was all very very random, and was akin to typical gambling where you have a false sense of control.  Still I tried to ""game"" the system and find the ""hot"" word whenever I could.","34"
"A2IZ2W58WQXPKH_m3r5","2015-01-12","17:25:08","rp_moral_1","I just went across the 4 word choices left to right until I got a positive outcome. Stayed on that word until it got negative then continued to work my way around to each of the words. ","35"

"AG20MAXFDIF5J_m3r5","2015-01-12","17:59:35","rp_moral_1","My strategy was to keep coming back to the numbers that led to the words that awarded points most often.

"AAJEPFSQNC6X_m3r5","2015-01-12","18:25:12","rp_moral_1","If I know that I am getting points on a certain word then of course I would keep trying the numbers over and over again. If I would notice I was losing points then I would take the same number again but choose the other word assuming that it might be giving out points. If that one is not giving out points either then I move on to the other numbers and repeat the steps.","60"
"A154XH0IEZG247_m3r5","2015-01-12","18:29:18","rp_moral_1","If I got points from it, I tended to repeat. Other than that, I thought it was kind of hard.","61"

"A1KXYURHCYHKOL_m3r5","2015-01-12","18:48:48","rp_moral_1","Monetary decisions based on my immediate needs and payoff. If the payoff was big enough, it was worth the wait. Moral decisions were difficult. One is tempted to always go for the saving of most lives, but having to participate in the taking of a life to do that is a difficult decision to make.","72"
"A14TRU3V93NVFX_m3r5","2015-01-12","18:49:56","rp_moral_1","I suppose the closest thing to a strategy was just using my gut feeling to determine whether a set of numbers felt ""lucky"" or not given whether I won points or not.","73"
"A3NDYVCFCYRPT9_m3r5","2015-01-12","18:55:48","rp_moral_1","Hi! This was a really fun experiment. I encountered one bug. The ""lily pad"" question did not display the full question. It stopped after the phrase ""how long,"" so I left that box blank. As to your question about any strategy I might have used, I think I tried to be methodical in the order I chose the numbers and words, but then relied on my gut when deciding which pathway was ""hot"" or ""cold."" In other words, I started with the ""11111"" box and tried to test the corresponding word boxes in order. If I found a word that was winning points I stuck with it until I felt it growing cold. If I only found losing words, I tested the next number and word combination in order (basically left to right).","74"

"A32CRWJESR6AX4_dg_v15","2015-06-01","21:14:12","absolute_v1","The absolute value trials gave the opposite value. For example, if Blue just had a value of -5 then it would have a value of +5 during the absolute value trial. The strategy I used was to choose the color that had the lowest value (preferably a negative value) just before the start of the absolute value trial because that way I would end up with a number that had a positive value.

"A37GLSRKYLXRT3_dg_v15","2015-06-01","21:20:22","absolute_v1","They were different because it came up green (20% of the time) which was random and not blue or red which could be somewhat predicted if paid attention to. The strategy I used was once the color got to a 0 point value I would aim for the other color.","974"
