Possible prediction errors (assuming 1 trial type, no smart MF-action):

After making top-level choice & receiving green,
	MF-action PE on top-level choice w/ V(green)-V(top-level action)
	MF-goal PE w/ V(green)-V(top-level)???
After clicking on green,
	MF-action PE on green w/ reward-V(green)
	MF-action PE on top-level choice w/ elig*(reward-V(green)) - but this is the same as above
	MF-goal PE on reward-V(top-level goal)
	
Okay how many PEs do we have:
(1) V(green) - V(top action)
(2) reward - V(green)
(3) reward - V(top action)
(4) reward - V(top goal)
