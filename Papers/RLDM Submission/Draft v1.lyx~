\begin_layout Abstract
The distinction between habitual and goal-directed action is fundamental
 to decision-making research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dolan2013goalsand"

\end_inset

.
 Habits form as stimulus-response pairings are “stamped in” following reward.
 In contrast, goal-directed behavior requires planning over a causal model.
 Many existing models portray habitual and goal-directed systems as competing
 for behavioral control 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "daw2005uncertaintybased"

\end_inset

, but evidence suggests they may be codependent.
 Goals exhibit habit-like properties, such as automatic activation under
 contextual cuing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "huang2014theselfish"

\end_inset

 and susceptibility to unconscious reinforcement 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "custers2005positive"

\end_inset

.
 Also, in complex real-world scenarios, selecting a goal out of potentially
 infinitely many candidates seems like an intractable problem, yet people
 solve it with ease – suggesting that a more efficient decision making system
 is influencing goal selection.
 We propose that goal selection can be under habitual control.
 Across two experiments, we demonstrate that people naturally form habitual
 goals which are “stamped in” by reward, but which subsequently guide behavior
 through model-based forward planning.
 The role of habitual control in goal-directed action has potential implications
 for a range of issues, including the contextual nature of cognitive skills,
 the nature of addiction, and the origin of the moral “doctrine of double
 effect”.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rich line of decision-making research relies on the distinction between
 goal-directed and habitual behavior 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dolan2013goalsand"

\end_inset

.
 When pursuing goals, people “plan ahead” over a causal model of their environme
nt and select actions which are most likely to lead to goal fulfillment.
 For example, a dieter will turn down a slice of cake because he/she is
 pursuing the goal of weight loss.
 This method of action selection is flexible and powerful, but becomes computati
onally difficult as the causal model grows in complexity.
 On the other hand, habits are simple stimulus-response patterns which get
 “stamped in” by reinforcement 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "graybiel2008habitsrituals"

\end_inset

.
 For example, rats trained to press a food-releasing lever will continue
 to press the lever even when they are no longer hungry – pressing the lever
 has been habitualized 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dolan2013goalsand"

\end_inset

.
 Forming habits based on reinforcement patterns is an inflexible but efficient
 alternative to goal-directed behavior, a way to quickly selection actions
 which usually lead to reward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These behavioral patterns are often formalized in the language of reinforcement
 learning (RL), an influential computational framework for modeling decision-mak
ing processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sutton1998introduction"

\end_inset

.
 There are two broad classes of RL algorithms.
 Model-based algorithms maintain an internal causal model of the environment
 and assess actions according to their likely consequences, thus enabling
 goal-directed planning.
 In contrast, model-free algorithms do not maintain a causal model, but
 instead select actions according to their context-dependent history of
 reinforcement.
 The resulting stimulus-response habits are globally adaptive, but may exhibit
 local irrationality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "daw2011modelbased"

\end_inset

.
 RL models capture several core elements of human choice, including prediction-e
rror updating in the midbrain dopamine system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "niv2009reinforcement"

\end_inset

 and hierarchical arrangement of goals in model-based planning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "botvinick2009hierarchically"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two systems, goal-directed (model-based) and habitual (model-free),
 are often portrayed as competing for control of action selection 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "daw2005uncertaintybased"

\end_inset

.
 But we propose a cooperative interaction: goal selection itself can be
 habitualized.
 There are two reasons to suspect a habitual influence on goal selection.
 The first is that goals exhibit habit-like properties.
 They can be automatically activated by contextual stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "huang2014theselfish"

\end_inset

, they can be unconsciously reinforced 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "custers2005positive"

\end_inset

, and they can drive behavior without conscious awareness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "huang2014theselfish"

\end_inset

.
 These properties suggest that the system which produces stimulus-response
 habits might also act on goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second reason is that, in a complicated world, selecting goals by exhaustive
ly searching the candidate goal space is computationally infeasible – there
 are too many candidates.
 For example, a person trying to satisfy their hunger would have to consider
 every possible goal, from turning on the TV to cleaning the bathroom to
 making a sandwich.
 Forming stimulus-goal habits based on reinforcement patterns would be a
 solution to this problem, a way to quickly select goals which usually lead
 to reward.
 If the goal “make a sandwich” is consistently rewarded with successful
 hunger reduction, it would become habitualized and automatically activate
 in the context of hunger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test whether people form habitualized goals, we developed a decision-making
 paradigm that isolates the behavioral influence of model-free goal selection.
 Over two experiments, we demonstrated that people spontaneously and robustly
 form habitual goals, which are

 by reward but guide action through model-based planning.

\begin_layout Section
Experiments and Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test for a model-free influence on goal selection, we adapted a multistep
 choice paradigm designed to dissociate the influence of habitual and goal-direc
ted behavior 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "glascher2010statesversus"

\end_inset

.
 Participants played a decision-making game where they chose between four
 buttons, numbered 1-4 (Figure 1a).
 Buttons 1 and 3 usually led to a blue shape, and buttons 2 and 4 usually
 led to a red shape.
 But each button had a 20% chance of leading to a green shape instead.
 Participants received bonus points for getting different colors – blue
 was worth a certain amount, red a different amount, etc.
 Some colors won points, others lost points.
 But the value of each color drifted throughout the experiment, so participants
 had to adapt their choices to the current color values in order to maximize
 their winnings.
 On every trial, participants were presented with two out of the four buttons.
 They made their choice, transitioned to a colored shape, clicked on the
 shape, and received their bonus points.

Task structure and logic.
 a, In Experiment 1 participants performed a two-stage decision task.
 In Stage 1, they were presented with two options drawn from a set of four
 possible options.
 These transitioned with variable probabilities to a set of Stage 2 shapes,
 which then transitioned deterministically to a set of drifting reward distribut
ions.
 b, The logic of the experiment depends on a subset of critical trials.
 For instance, participants might be presented with options 1 and 2 in a
 setup trial.
 Upon selecting option 1, they experience a low-probability transition to
 the green state and receive a large reward.
 A habitual influence on goal selection uniquely predicts an increase in
 the selection of option 3 on the subsequent critical trial, because options
 1 and 3 share the common color-goal of blue.

The presence of low-probability transitions to green allowed us to isolate
 a model-free influence on action selection 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "glascher2010statesversus"

\end_inset

.
 Through instruction and practice, participants were made well aware of
 the game’s transitional structure.
 Specifically, they knew that each button had an equally likely chance of
 randomly transitioning to green – you couldn’t plan to get to green.
 So whenever participants transitioned to green, the reinforcement they
 received could not be incorporated into a model-based planning mechanism.
 On the other hand, model-free responses are blind to causal structure –
 they simply respond to reinforcement.
 So if participants become more likely to select the same action following
 a rewarding low-probability transition to green, and less likely following
 a punishing transition to green, the effect can only be due to a model-free
 influence on action selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we wanted to isolate a model-free influence on goal selection,
 not action selection.
 Our analysis relied on a crucial subset of trials (Figure 1b).
 On the “setup” trial, participants were presented with a pair of buttons
 – say, buttons 1 and 2.
 Participants selected a button, experienced a low-probability transition
 to green, and either received a reward or punishment.
 Then, on the “critical” trial, they were presented with the button that
 had the same color-goal as the button they just chose.
 For example, if the participant chose button 1, on the next trial they
 would be presented with button 3 (paired with either 2 or 4).
 1 and 3 have the same color-goal because they both usually lead to blue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the setup trial was a low-probability transition to green, a model-based
 planning system would not directly incorporate the reinforcement into its
 action selection process.
 Also, while a model-free action selection system would incorporate the
 reinforcement into its likelihood of selecting button 1, it would not learn
 anything about button 3, because choosing button 3 is a different action.
 So current models of the goal-directed and habitual systems predict that
 the reinforcement received on setup trials would have no effect on the
 likelihood of choosing button 3 in the critical trial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if participants are forming habits of goal selection, then that
 reinforcement would have an effect.
 When selecting button 1, participants form a goal akin to “get blue”.
 If forming that goal is rewarded, participants would start to form a habit
 of selecting that goal – and because buttons 1 and 3 have the same goal,
 they would be more likely to select button 3 on the next trial.
 Similarly, if forming that goal is punished, participants would be less
 likely to select button 3.
 And that is what we find (Figure 2a).
 On average, participants were more likely to choose the button with the
 same color-goal after a rewarding trial (89% of choices) than after a punishing
 trial (69% of choices).
 The difference was significant (repeated measures t-test, t(134) = 12.5,
 p < .0001).

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative interpretation of our result is that, instead of forming
 true habitual goals, participants were merely forming habits of “abstracted”
 actions – actions which somehow incorporated both buttons 1 and 3.
 To address this concern, we ran a second experiment in which we tested
 whether the representations being habitualized could be flexibly integrated
 into an independent causal model.
 This integration is a hallmark of goal-directed planning, but unlikely
 for “abstracted” actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Experiment 2, before proceeding to the real task, participants were trained
 on a set of intuitive transitions from letter buttons (A,B,C,D) to number
 buttons (1,2,3,4).
 A led to 1, B to 2, etc (Figure 3a).
 Then the task proceeded as before, with participants choosing between number
 buttons, transitioning to colors, and receiving reinforcement.
 Except now participants were informed that, on some trials, instead of
 choosing between number buttons, they would choose between letter buttons
 (and subsequently transition to the corresponding number button).
 These “letter” trials always occurred on critical trials (Figure 3b).
 So if, on a setup trial, a participant chose button 1 and transitioned
 to green, on the next trial they would be presented with button C (paired
 with either B or D).
 If participants were truly forming habitual goals, then they would be more
 likely to choose the letter button with the same color-goal after a rewarding
 critical trial than after a punishing critical trial.
 And that is again what we find (Figure 2b).
 On average, participants were more likely to choose the letter button with
 the same color-goal after a rewarding trial (85% of choices) than after
 a punishing trial (69% of choices).
 The difference was significant (t(172) = -9.17, p < .0001).

 Experiment 2 was modeled on the design of Experiment 1, except that a,
 participants performed a pre-training in which they learned deterministic
 transitions between Stage 0 letters and Stage 1 numbers, and b, on critical
 trials the Stage 0 choices were selectively reintroduced.
 Thus, in order to make successful choices on critical trials, participants
 were required to choose a Stage 0 letter that would lead to their preferred
 Stage 1 number.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As outlined above, our hypothesis can help explain the habit-like properties
 of goals, as well as the ease with which humans select goals out of a potential
ly infinite candidate space.
 Our hypothesis also has implications for a range of other issues.
 For example, it is debated whether complex cognitive skills are general
 or “context-bound” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "perkins1989arecognitive"

\end_inset

.
 The debate hinges on what it means to have acquired a cognitive skill.
 People often break complex cognitive tasks down into a hierarchy of goals
 and subgoals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "botvinick2009hierarchically"

\end_inset

 – for example, long division is taught as the sequential completion of
 five subgoals (divide, multiply, subtract, bring down, repeat).
 Acquiring a cognitive skill might boil down to acquiring the proper habitual
 subgoal activations (“divide, then multiply, then subtract…”) in the context
 of higher goals (“perform long division”) or external stimuli (seeing a
 division problem on your test).
 This approach suggests a critical role for context in cognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a more pernicious domain, it is also debated whether drug addiction is
 primarily a habitual or goal-directed phenomenon 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "olmstead2001cocaine,everitt2001theneuropsychological"

\end_inset

.
 Addicts’ behavior seems to blend canonical features of habits and goals
 – cravings are activated automatically by contextual cues, but addicts
 will perform actions to obtain drugs that clearly transcend simple stimulus-res
ponse pairings.
 Our hypothesis offers a synthesis of these views.
 Addiction can be both habitual and goal-directed, with contextual cues
 activating the goal of obtaining drugs (which can then guide actions in
 a model-based way).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in the realm of moral philosophy, the Doctrine of Double Effect
 (DDE) is a widely invoked moral principle which states that it is wrong
 to harm others as a means to an end, but acceptable to harm them as a side
 effect 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mcintyre2010doctrine"

\end_inset

.
 Many psychologists have argued that our intuitions supporting the DDE are
 an accidental “byproduct of cognitive architecture” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cushman2014thepsychological"

\end_inset

, but there are competing theories for what produces those intuitions.
 Our hypothesis offers an elegant explanation.
 In order to harm somebody as a means, you have to form a goal of harming
 them.
 But forming that goal is consistently punished 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cushman2013actionoutcome"

\end_inset

.
 If goals can respond to reinforcement, people will end up with an aversion
 to forming the “harm someone” goal, making them averse to harming people
 as a means but not to harming them as a side effect.
