%% CriticalTrials
% This script gathers the data for a logistic regression analysis.

%% Fixed Effects
% What are the predictors for a given trial with options X and Y?
% - MB_X: The last reinforcement value from the goal associated with option
%   X
% - MB_Y: The last reinforcement value from the goal associated with option
%   Y
% - MF_X: The last reinforcement value from choosing option X
% - MF_Y: The last reinforcement value from choosing option Y
% - MFonMB_X:
%   If on a critical trial w/ critical option X, use the reinforcement value from the last trial.
%   If on a critical trial w/ critical option Y, use the reinforcement
%       value from the last time you chose either option Y or its other
%       corresponding option
%   Otherwise, 0
% - MFonMB_Y:
%   If on a critical trial w/ critical option Y, use the reinforcement value from the last trial.
%   If on a critical trial w/ critical option X, use the reinforcement
%       value from the last time you chose either option X or its other
%       corresponding option
%   Otherwise, 0

%% Random Effects
% Subject: the subject ID number

%% Dependent Variable
% choices: 0 for option X, 1 for option Y

%% Notes
% - I'm currently keeping in trials that have the same corresponding goal
% for both options (these only exist because I messed up)
