These simulations were with:
- Full model
- All weights done fairly (i.e. rand() for each, divide each by sum)
- Equal goal-learner
- Model: lr, temp, elig, weight_mb, weight_smf, weight_gl
- Board: normal, w/ 5 option

Results:
- GL weights were somewhat recoverable, but our model wasn't the better fit
