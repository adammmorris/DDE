These simulations were with:
- No dumb model-free learner
- weight_mb = rand(), weight_smf = 1-weight_mb
- Servant goal-learner
- Model: lr, temp, weight_mb, weight_gl (elig fixed @ .8 I think)
- Board: normal, w/ 5 option

Results:
- Our model was the better fit, but the GL weights were actually unrecoverable
