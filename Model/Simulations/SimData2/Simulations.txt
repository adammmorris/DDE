These simulations were with:
- Full model
- weight_mb = rand(), weight_smf = rand()*(1-weight_mb), weight_dmf = 1-others
- Servant goal-learner
- Model: lr, temp, elig, weight_mb, weight_smf, weight_gl
- Board: normal, w/ 5 option

Results:
- Our model was the better fit, but the GL weights were still unrecoverable
