%% DDE Project - Adam Morris, Nov. 2013 %%
% This is our model for our experiment
% Meant to show model-free learning on model-based goals
% Model combines both types of RL learners
% Much of this is drawn from Daw's 2-step task

% Our model:
% One model-based RL learner
% One dumb model-free SARSA learner (dumb because it doesn't recognize
%   trial type)
% One goal-learning model-free learner

% Version 2:
% - Model-based learner now searches through feature space
% - We now can run multiple agents

% Version 3:
% - Added dumb model-free learner
% - Fixed major bug in model-based learner
% - Added goal-learning model-free learner

% Version 4:
% - Changing model-based learner to work off goals

% Version 5:
% - Reducing # of parameters
% - Made 'params' able to be different for each agent

% Version 6:
% - Cutting out the dumb model-free learner from the decision-making (too many parameters)
% - Fixed major bug in model-based learner

% Version 7:
% - Trying to add back in dumb model-free learner (now that I have 4 cores
%   on my laptop ^^ yay parfor)
% - Making the servant/equal thing a parameter
% - Added round# to the results array

%% From 'board.mat':
% (1) trialTypes(thisBoard,thisRound) gives you the trial type of this round
% (2) options1(thisBoard,thisRound,:) gives you the actions (2 of them) available to the agent in the
%   first level at the given round
% (3) transitions(thisBoard,thisRound,choice) gives you the second-level state to which agent transitions (the actual one, not
%   the prob) by taking 'choice' in the given round
%   Note that choice is the option #
% (4) rewards(thisBoard,thisRound, trialType, featureValue) gives you the reward of the
%   feature value along the given trial type dimension
%   Technically you only get rewards in the third-level, but, since there's
%   only action you can do (i.e. click on the letter), for now we can just
%   treat it this way
% (5) numTrialTypes: this is 2 right now
% (6) features(state, trialType) gives you the feature value for the given
%   state along the given trial type dimension
% (7) numFeatureValues: this is 3 right now
% (8) goals(trialType,featureValue) gives you the corresponding goal #

%% Inputs:
% params should be [lr beta elig_trace]
%   it can be just a 1x4 vector, in which case it applies to all agents
%   or it can be an nx4, where n is numAgents
% weights should be [modelBased smartModelFree dumbModelFree goalLearner]
% numRounds should be [numPracticeRounds numRealRounds]
% numAgents should be how many agents you want to run
% servant: set to 0 if you want the goal learner to be treated equally
%   (i.e. an independent weight parameter), or set to 1 if you want the
%   goal learner to be treated as a servant to the model-based system (i.e.
%   its weight must be <= to the model-based weight; its weight here really represents what % of the model-based weight it should have)
% boardName: should be something like 'board', or 'board_no5'
% magicBoard: this is gimmicky, but set this to anything nonzero to make
%   every agent play that same board#

%% Outputs
% earnings has the earnings for every agent
% negLL has the negLL for every agent
% results is a (numAgents*numRounds) x 8 matrix;
%   columns are id, trialType, option1, option2, choice, state2, reward,
%   and round#

%% Remarks

% - Throughout this whole thing, be VERY careful to distinguish (and
%   convert) between action space, state space, and feature space

    % Set up the Q matrices
    % Each matrix has the form: numRelevantStates x numActions x
    %   numTrialTypes
    %
    % The numAction is always going to be numStates - 1
    % Why? The top-level state has that many choices.  So just to keep things
    %   all in one matrix, we'll set that many actions for each state.
    % But for all rows > 1, all columns > 1 should be zero
    %
    % What about numRelevantStates?
    % There are subtleties here.

    % For the model-based system, we have numGoals states
    % Why? Because for second-level states, it seeks feature values, not states
    % This is how it 'sets goals'
    % But we still need the +1 for the top-level state
    % And we still have numOptions actions
    % So it conceptualizes the world as numOptions actions in the first
    %   level which can lead to numGoals states in the second level
    Q_modelBased = zeros(numGoals+1,numOptions);
