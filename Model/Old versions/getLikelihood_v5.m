%% getLikelihood
% This calculates the likelihood of a given set of rounds given our
%    model, which currently has:
%    model-based system, smart model-free system, dumb model-free system,
%    & goal-learner
% To calculate the likelihood under the null model, just force the
%   goal-learner weight to be 0
% And to drop a model (such as SMF), just force its weight to be 0

%% Inputs:
% params should be the 6x1 vector [lr,beta,elig_trace,weight_mb,weight_smf,weight_gl]
% practiceCutoff should be the first trial # that's not a practice round

% Version 2:
% - Fixed the eligibility trace at .75
% - Cut out the dumb model-free learner (too many parameters)
% - Fixed major bug in model-based learner

% Version 4:
% - Putting back in dumb model-free learner
% - Unfixing elig trace
% - Making servant a parameter
% - Cut out numRounds parameter, making it learn the true numRounds from
% the other inputs
% - Fixed MAJOR bug: have to add +1 to the S2 ('newstate') you get from the
% DDE game (b/c it gives it to you in 1-5, and we need it in 2-6)
% - Added realPeople parameter to account for the above bug

% Version 5 (May 1, 2014):
% - Fixed another MAJOR bug: In setting weight_DMF, I was ignoring
% weight_GL.
% - Removed realPeople param (b/c it's being accounted for in
% preprocessing).  Also cut out the +1

%% Initialize stuff

% Set up the Q matrices
% Each matrix has the form: numRelevantStates x numActions x
%   numTrialTypes
%
% The numAction is always going to be numStates - 1
% Why? The top-level state has that many choices.  So just to keep things
%   all in one matrix, we'll set that many actions for each state.
% But for all rows > 1, all columns > 1 should be zero
%
% What about numRelevantStates?
% There are subtleties here.

% For the model-based system, we have numGoals states
% Why? Because for second-level states, it seeks feature values, not states
% This is how it 'sets goals'
% But we still need the +1 for the top-level state
% And we still have numOptions actions
% So it conceptualizes the world as numOptions actions in the first
%   level which can lead to numGoals states in the second level
Q_modelBased = zeros(numGoals+1,numOptions);

% For the smart model-free system, it doesn't know about feature values; it just
%   learns about states & action choices
% So numRelevantStates = numStates
% But it still knows about trial types
Q_smartModelFree = zeros(numStates,numOptions,numTrialTypes);

% The dumb model-free system is the same as the smart one, except it
%   doesn't know about trial types
Q_dumbModelFree = zeros(numStates,numOptions);

% The goal-learning model-free system is special.
% It has one state, the first one, and it has numGoals actions
% The way goals are numbered is captured in 'goals' (set in board.mat)
Q_goalLearner = zeros(1,numGoals);

% Initialize transition counts/probabilities
transition_counts = repmat([0 ones(1,numOptions)],numOptions,1); % rows are which action you chose in level 1; columns are which state you got to in level 2 (so first column should be zeros)
initialProbs = [0 (1/numOptions)*ones(1,numOptions)]; % for any given row, initially a uniform dist. (except state 1)

        % (i.e. clicking the letter)
        % But those transitions are deterministic and don't need to be
