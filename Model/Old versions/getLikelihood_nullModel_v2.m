%% getLikelihood_nullModel
% This calculates the likelihood of a given set of rounds given our null
%    model, which currently has:
%    model-based system, smart model-free system, dumb model-free system

%% Inputs:
% params should be the 4x1 vector [lr,beta,mb_weight]

% Version 2:
% - Fixed the eligibility trace at .75
% - Cut out the dumb model-free learner from the decision-making
% - Fixed major bug in model-based learner

function [negLL] = getLikelihood_nullModel_v2(params,numRounds,ourTrialTypes,ourOption1,ourOption2,ourChoices,ourState2,ourRewards)

%% Set board params
load('C:\Personal\School\Brown\Psychology\DDE Project\Model\board.mat');

% Set up round parameters
numTotalRounds = sum(numRounds);
numPracticeRounds = numRounds(1);
numRealRounds = numRounds(2);

% Get numOptions & numStates
numOptions = size(transitions,3);
numGoals = numFeatureValues * numTrialTypes;
numStates = numOptions+1; % remember to preserve the state # integrity

%% Set agent params
% For parameters across models, we currently have: learning rate, temperature, eligibility trace
lr1 = params(1);
lr2 = lr1;
beta = params(2);
elig_trace = .75;

%% Initialize stuff

% Set up the Q matrices
% Each matrix has the form: numRelevantStates x numActions x
%   numTrialTypes
%
% The numAction is always going to be numStates - 1
% Why? The top-level state has that many choices.  So just to keep things
%   all in one matrix, we'll set that many actions for each state.
% But for all rows > 1, all columns > 1 should be zero
%
% What about numRelevantStates?
% There are subtleties here.

% For the model-based system, we have numGoals states
% Why? Because for second-level states, it seeks feature values, not states
% This is how it 'sets goals'
% But we still need the +1 for the top-level state
% And we still have numOptions actions
% So it conceptualizes the world as numOptions actions in the first
%   level which can lead to numGoals states in the second level
Q_modelBased = zeros(numGoals+1,numOptions);

% For the smart model-free system, it doesn't know about feature values; it just
%   learns about states & action choices
% So numRelevantStates = numStates
% But it still knows about trial types
Q_smartModelFree = zeros(numStates,numOptions,numTrialTypes);

% The dumb model-free system is the same as the smart one, except it
%   doesn't know about trial types
%Q_dumbModelFree = zeros(numStates,numOptions);

% Initialize transition counts/probabilities
transition_counts = repmat([0 ones(1,numOptions)],numOptions,1); % rows are which action you chose in level 1; columns are which state you got to in level 2 (so first column should be zeros)
initialProbs = [0 (1/numOptions)*ones(1,numOptions)]; % for any given row, initially a uniform dist. (except state 1)
transition_probs = repmat(initialProbs,numOptions,1);

        % Technically there's another action here, which technically leads to
        %   another state in which the agent actually receives his rewards.
        % (i.e. clicking the letter)
        % But those transitions are deterministic and don't need to be
        %   learned, so maybe we won't have them in the practice rounds?
