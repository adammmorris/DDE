%% DDE Project - Adam Morris, Nov. 2013 %%
% This is our model for our experiment
% Meant to show model-free learning on model-based goals
% Model combines both types of RL learners
% Much of this is drawn from Daw's 2-step task

% Our model:
% One model-based RL learner
% One smart model-free SARSA learner (smart because it recognizes trial
%   type)
% One dumb model-free SARSA learner (dumb because it doesn't recognize
%   trial type)
% One goal-learning model-free learner

% Version 2:
% - Model-based learner now searches through feature space
% - We now can run multiple agents

% Version 3:
% - Added dumb model-free learner
% - Fixed major bug in model-based learner
% - Added goal-learning model-free learner

%% From 'board.mat':
% (1) trialTypes(thisBoard,thisRound) gives you the trial type of this round
% (2) options1(thisBoard,thisRound,:) gives you the actions (2 of them) available to the agent in the
%   first level at the given round
% (3) transitions(thisBoard,thisRound,choice) gives you the second-level state to which agent transitions (the actual one, not
%   the prob) by taking 'choice' in the given round
%   Note that choice is the option #
% (4) rewards(thisBoard,thisRound, trialType, featureValue) gives you the reward of the
%   feature value along the given trial type dimension
%   Technically you only get rewards in the third-level, but, since there's
%   only action you can do (i.e. click on the letter), for now we can just
%   treat it this way
% (5) numTrialTypes: this is 2 right now
% (6) features(state, trialType) gives you the feature value for the given
%   state along the given trial type dimension
% (7) numFeatureValues: this is 3 right now
% (8) goals(trialType,featureValue) gives you the corresponding goal #

%% Inputs:
% params should be [lr1 lr2 beta elig_trace stay_bonus]
% weights should be [modelBased smartModelFree dumbModelFree]
% numRounds should be [numPracticeRounds numRealRounds]
% numAgents should be how many agents you want to run

%% Remarks

% - Throughout this whole thing, be VERY careful to distinguish (and
%   convert) between action space, state space, and feature space

%% Let's do this!
for thisAgent = 1:numAgents
    %% Initialize stuff
    
    % Set up the Q matrices
    % Each matrix has the form: numRelevantStates x numActions x
    %   numTrialTypes
    %
    % The numAction is always going to be numStates - 1
    % Why? The top-level state has that many choices.  So just to keep things
    %   all in one matrix, we'll set that many actions for each state.
    % But for all rows > 1, all columns > 1 should be zero
    %
    % What about numRelevantStates?
    % There are subtleties here.

    % For the model-based system, we have numGoals
    % Why? Because for second-level states, it seeks feature values, not states
    % This is how it 'sets goals'
    % But we still need the +1 for the top-level state
    % And we still have numOptions actions
    % So it conceptualizes the world as numOptions actions in the first
    %   level which can lead to numFeatureValues states in the second level
    Q_modelBased = zeros(numFeatureValues+1,numOptions,numTrialTypes);

    % For the smart model-free system, it doesn't know about feature values; it just
    %   learns about states & action choices

    % The dumb model-free system is the same as the smart one, except it
    %   doesn't know about trial types
    Q_dumbModelFree = zeros(numStates,numOptions);
  
    % The goal-learning model-free system is special.
    % It has one state, the first one, and it has numFeatureValue x
    %   numTrialType actions - one for each goal the model-based system can set.
    % The way goals are numbered is captured in 'goals' (set in board.mat)
    Q_goalLearner = zeros(1,numFeatureValues * numTrialTypes);
